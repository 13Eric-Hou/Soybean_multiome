# Soybean_multiome
Soybean is a critical source of vegetable protein, yet its proteome remains under-characterized. Here, we quantify 12,855 proteins across 14 soybean tissues using 4D-data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (4D-DIA-MS), creating the most extensive soybean proteome dataset to date. Tissue-specific protein expression and co-expression analyses highlight functional specificity, with significant differences in protein-transcript abundance across tissues. We also map N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications, identifying their key role in post-transcriptional protein regulation. This comprehensive proteomic and m6A landscape advances our understanding of soybean biology and provides a valuable resource for crop improvement.
